A pomodoro clock is a simple way of managing your time. You set sessions and breaks. For example, set a session of 50 minutes with a break of 10 minutes. In this case you would work for 50 minutes, the timer beeps, then you have a break for 10 minutes, then another beep and you're back to the work session.
